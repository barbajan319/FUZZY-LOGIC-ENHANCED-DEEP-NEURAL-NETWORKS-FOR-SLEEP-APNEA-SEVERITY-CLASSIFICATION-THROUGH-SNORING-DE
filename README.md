# Snoring-Detection 

This project consists of the use of convolutional neural networks coupled with an raspberry pi for real time snoring detection.

The goal is to assess the severity of the snoring in real-time to classify the severity of a possible sleep apnea. Once the CNN detects snoring, important features from the audio are extracted and inputed into a fuzzy inference system in order to determine how severe the apnea symptoms are.
